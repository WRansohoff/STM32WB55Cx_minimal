Hi very sorry to bother you this way, I did not know how to contact you. I was wondering if you continued the developpment of this board ?

I'm making one with the same microcontroler plus a semtech LoRa chip. You can contact me at lionel.tombakdjian@etu.univ-cotedazur.fr :)

Best regards,

Lionel Tombakdjian
