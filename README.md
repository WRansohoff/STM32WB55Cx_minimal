# STM32WB55 Example Board

**NOTE: I haven't had a chance to test this board yet, so if you stumble across this, please wait a few weeks before trying to make one!** I'll update the repository with full gerber files and more information once I've checked that the board and radio/antenna/etc. work. It's my first RF design, so they might not.

But I'm trying to do a better job of documenting the board designs that I make, and hopefully this can eventually grow into a useful reference design. In the meantime, sorry for the inconvenience and stay tuned.
