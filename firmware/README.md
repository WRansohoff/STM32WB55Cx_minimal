# Test STM32WB55 Firmwares

This directory contains test firmwares for the board design that this repository demonstrates.

I haven't gotten any of the RF stuff working yet, so the only firmware right now is a simple 'blinking LED' program which toggles the on-board LED connected to PE4 to verify that the chip can be programmed, boot, and run an application.
