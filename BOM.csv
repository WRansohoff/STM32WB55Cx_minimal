AE1,Antenna,Custom,Unictron H2U262GKBA0100,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2h8zn,$0.64,"Trace antennas are cheaper, but this seemed like a less failure-prone option for a first attempt."
C1,Capacitor,0402,0.8 pF,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2hrp7,$0.15,"50Ω matching filter capacitor. I used the values from ST's evaluation board, figuring they'd probably be fairly close. Ideal values will vary based on your board stackup. Prefer high-quality ceramic capacitors (C0G/NP0)"
